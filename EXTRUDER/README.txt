The mount attaches to the x-carriage using the same four hole mounting system that is used on the Prusa I3 rework 1.5 kit, so you will need to print off a compatible x-carriage.My Prusa I3 X-Carriage: https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:2514659This design uses a clamp so your hotend will stay firmly in place and won't wobble around.More features are on the way including cable chain support and dual extrusion options. Please comment on anything you want me to implement and let me know of any problems  that you are having with my design.NotesThanks to Josef Prusa. I took inspiration from the Prusa MK2s.
